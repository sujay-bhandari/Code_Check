- Accent color: Green (#2ECC71) to highlight corrected code or successful analysis results.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for both headings and body, for a clean and modern look. 'Source Code Pro' for code snippets.

- A clean, single-column layout for displaying code, errors, and suggestions in a logical order.
- Use subtle animations to draw attention to newly identified errors or updated code sections.
